https://github.com/greek1979/jeval
----------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

JEval is the advanced library for adding mathematical, string, Boolean and 
functional expression parsing and evaluation to your Java applications. 

JEval Features:

* Parses and evaluates dynamic and static expressions at run time.
* A great solution for filtering data at runtime.
* Supports mathematical, Boolean, String and functional expressions.
* Supports all major mathematical and Boolean operators.
* Supports custom functions.
* 43 Math and String functions built in and ready to use.
* Supports nested functions.
* Supports variables.
* Allows for custom variable resolver.
* No reparsing of expressions when variables change.
* No dependencies to other non-standard Java libraries.
* JUnit tests.
* Compatible with J2SE 1.6 and above.

2. RELEASE INFO

JEval requires J2SE 1.6 and above.  This release was tested using jdk 1.8.0_221 
running in Java 1.6 compatibility mode.

Release contents:
* "src/main" contains the Java source files for the project
* "src/test" contains the Java source files for the project's test suite
* "dist" contains the project distribution jar files
* "lib" contains all third-party libraries needed for running the samples and/or 
building the framework
* "docs/api" contains general documentation and API Javadocs
* "samples" contains demo applications
* "gradle" includes Gradle libraries to support Gradle build script

Ant build scripts for the project and the samples are provided. The standard
