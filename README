JEval, release 0.9.8 beta (September 2025)
https://greek1979.github.io/jeval/
----------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

JEval is the advanced library for adding mathematical, String, Boolean and 
functional expression parsing and evaluation to your Java applications.
Custom expression variables and plug-in functions are supported as well.

Key Features of JEval library:

* Parses and evaluates dynamic and static expressions at run time
* A great solution for filtering data at runtime
* Supports mathematical, Boolean, String and functional expressions
* Supports all major mathematical and Boolean operators
* Supports custom functions
* 47 Math and String functions built in and ready to use
* Supports nested functions
* Supports variables
* Allows for custom variable resolver
* No reparsing of expressions when variables change
* No dependencies to other non-standard Java libraries
* JUnit tests
* Compatible with Java 8 (J2SE 1.8) and above

With some code review and minimum changes, the library can run on Java 7
(J2SE 1.7 and compatible runtimes) as well, although this is not something
generally advised. But hey, if there is a need, it can be made to function.

2. RELEASE INFO

JEval requires Java 8 and above. This release was tested using jdk 1.8.0_221 
running in Java 8 compatibility mode.

Release contents:
* "src/main" contains the Java source files for the project
* "src/test" contains the Java source files for the project's test suite
* "dist" contains the project distribution jar files
* "lib" contains all third-party libraries needed for running the samples and 
building the framework
* "docs" contains general documentation and API Javadocs
* "samples" contains demo applications

Ant build scripts for the project and the samples are provided. The standard 
samples can be built with the included Ant runtime by invoking the corresponding
"ant-build.bat" files (see samples subdirectories). Ant build generates the
"dist" and "docs" directories.

Apache Maven build profile is also provided here, and the project can be built,
packaged, and deployed to local repository with relevant Maven commands.

The JEval project is released under the terms of the Apache Software License 
(see LICENSE). All libraries included in the "lib" directory are subject to 
their respective licenses.

Old project site at SourceForge ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/jeval/ ) has
been deprecated and removed. JEval is superceded by mXparser library for math
expressions only, while this source is provided for backward compatibility and
to assist in possible troubleshooting of existing applications.

3. DISTRIBUTION JAR FILES

The "dist" directory contains the following distinct jar files for use in 
applications.

* "JEval" (~86 KB)
- Contents: JEval API

4. WHERE TO START?

Documentation can be found in the "docs" directory:
* JEval Javadoc - see Evaluator class for implementation details

Documented sample applications can be found in "samples":
* Boolean operations
* Custom functions
* Looping with variables
* Mathematical functions
* Mathematical operations
* Nested functions
* String functions
* String operations
* Variables

5. THREAD SAFETY NOTICE

The main Evaluator class is a non-reentrant, not-thread-safe implementation. For
every expression to parse and evaluate, a dedicated instance of Evaluator MUST BE
instantiated OR an existing instance can be reused, assuming it is not longer used
by the previous caller. Keeping multiple Evaluator instances in the shared object
pool should be fine, as long as each instance is used by a single execution thread.

6. AUTHORS AND CONTRIBUTORS

Original version of JEval was developed and published by Rob Breidecker (please
contact him at rbreidec@gmail.com for details) and released under the terms of the
Apache License 2.0. The last version available in Maven Central artifacts repo
is 0.9.4 from 2011. Afterwards, project was hibernated and subsequently, removed.
